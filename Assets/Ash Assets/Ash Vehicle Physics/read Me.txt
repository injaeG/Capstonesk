do not import the old version "AshVP old with bike.unitypackage" in same project as the new version. 
first delete new version from project.
In the original package, bikes were not there. I added them later as a bonus. 
But it was hard to maintain them. so i removed them. 
you can use the old version if you need bikes. but you will have to setup bikes manually.
